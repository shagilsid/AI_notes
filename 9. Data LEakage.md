# Data Leakage
Leakage will come up frequently, and it will ruin your models in subtle and dangerous ways. So, this is one of the most important concepts for practicing data scientists.

Data leakage (or leakage) happens when your training data contains information about the target, but similar data will not be available when the model is used for prediction. This leads to high performance on the training set (and possibly even the validation data), but the model will perform poorly in production.

**In other words, leakage causes a model to look accurate until you start making decisions with the model, and then the model becomes very inaccurate.**

2 types of leakage:
1. Target Leakage
2. Train-test contamination


## 1. Target Leakage
Target leakage occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions.
